#  Project name
form-validator

# Project description
Javascript project for a basic form with validation for passwords, email and username

# Why I built it
Practice for validating areas of a form and basic JS concepts

# What I would do next
Include more areas to the form such as address and phone number and possibly some type of captcha to avoid bots. Add additional requirements such as needing a number, symbol and capital letter for the password

# What I learned
I learned how to create a shorter event listener and that comments in my code are helpful for finding certain functions quickly

# Stack information
HMTL, CSS, Vanilla Javascript

# How to use it
Input username, email and password information and submit the form. Make sure that each field is the required length.
