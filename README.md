#  Project Name
Form-validator

# Project Description
Javascript project for a basic form with validation for passwords, email and username.

# Why I Built It
Practice for validating areas of a form and basic JS concepts

# What I Would Do Next
Include more areas to the form such as address and phone number and possibly some type of captcha to avoid bots. Add additional requirements such as needing a number, symbol and capital letter for the password.

# What I Learned
I learned how to create a shorter event listener and that comments in my code are helpful for finding certain functions quickly.

# Stack Information
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla Javascript

# How To Use It
Input username, email and password information and submit the form. Make sure that each field is the required length.
